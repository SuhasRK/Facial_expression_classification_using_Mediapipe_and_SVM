# Facial Expression classification using Mediapipe and SVM

Optical Character Recognition is the technique that recognizes and converts text into a machine-readable format by analyzing and understanding its underlying patterns.

OCR algorithms understand the underlying features of the text and predict the corresponding output for it using Neural networks. OCR can predict the output accurately and that too in a matter of milliseconds.
## Libraries used

**Mediapipe :** MediaPipe is Google's open-source framework, used for media processing.In this project I have used this library to detect landmarks on the face.

**OpenCV** 

**Numpy** 

**Pandas** 

**Scikit Learn**
